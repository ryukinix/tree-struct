# tree-struct

An implementation of binary tree algorithms. And it's all written in ANSI C - or pretended to be.

## History

I'm creating a binary tree that include support to 3 types of data. They are:
  * `struct`
  * `union`
  * `enum`

+â†‘ **Updated**

Representing the binary tree below! See:

## Compiling and Using

It's very simple, on main directory only do this:
  * `make`
  * `./binary-tree.out`
