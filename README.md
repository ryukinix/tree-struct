# tree-struct

Few implementations of tree algorithms. On beginning, trying to make a implementation on ANSI C. 

## History

I'm trying create a binary tree with a smart method to choose any type. 
Meta-type? To do so, attempting to us:
  * `struct`
  * `union`
  * `enum`

+↑ **Updated**

I did can something! See:
